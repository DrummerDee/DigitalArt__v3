    <p> Nancy was born in Virgina Beach Virgina, as one of the best story tellers on the planet Earth. When recalling stories she wouldn't leave out any details because she could never forget them ; especially when reliving funny stories about her husband. One of the most favorite things she adored was art.She enjoyed drawing and painting but her specialty was stained glass. Each panel of glass had such significant meaning that it was shocking to see how a panel could tell so much. Besides creating art, Nancy also enjoyed waking up early in the day and going fishing. She was filled with such child like wonder and excitement. Nancy, unfortunately had a rare case of lung cancer while living in New Orleans. Nancy passed away lying next to the love of her life. We want to remember Nancy by her beautiful art and the family that she created that misses and love her dearly. </p>
